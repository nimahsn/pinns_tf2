# PINNs
TensorFlow 2 implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) based on [Physics Informed Deep Learning (Part I): Data-driven Solutions of  Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10561).
Implemented equations are
- Heat,
- Wave,
- Reaction-Diffusion,
- Stationary Advection-Diffusion,
- Poisson,
- Schrodinger's,
- Burger's,
- Klein Gordon,
- and Transport.

Examples of each PINN are available in the notebooks.
