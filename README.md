# PINNs
Tensoflow 2 implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) based on [Physics Informed Deep Learning (Part I): Data-driven Solutions of  Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10561).
Impleneted equations are
- Heat,
- Wave,
- Reaction-Diffusion,
- Stationary Advection-Diffusion,
- Poisson,
- Schrodinger's,
- Burger's,
- Klein Gordon.
- and Transport.

Examples of each equation are available in the notebooks. This implementation is not a general PDE solver, but you can write your own PINN model similarly.
